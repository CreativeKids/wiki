## Week 1 Overview

Ready to get started with the Creative Computing Online Workshop?

Begin with this welcome and overview video. Then, introduce yourself in the workshop forums, and create an electronic design notebook to document your learning.

Maintaining a design notebook is an important part of the Creative Computing learning experience -- it is where you will be documenting, reflecting on, and getting feedback about your learning and your creations.

We recommend using Google Presentation as the medium for your design notebook -- but any web-based format that can be commented on and viewed by others works too. If you are looking for inspiration about what the design notebook might look like, explore our collection of workshop facilitators' design notebooks or the collection of design notebooks from the first CCOW cohort.
