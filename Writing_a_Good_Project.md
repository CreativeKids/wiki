# Writing a good project

A project should be inspiring to the student. The goal is not to have them learn something by rote, rather, the goal is for students to become inspired so that they may then go on to learn further and create something on their own.

Projects should be age-appropriate and context-appropriate. Think carefully about your target audience. Ensure that the project is applicable to as wide a range of children as possible, giving careful consideration to cultural differences.

Although a good project is simple, clear and has a step-by- step list of actions don’t forget to incorporate elements of creativity. Having students customise and tailor the project to their own interests provides a far more compelling and engaging project than one with a single predetermined path of output.

Use challenges to offer opportunities for advanced students to demonstrate their knowledge. It also ensures that no student is left saying “What do I do now?” 

Finally, focus on fun. Don’t forget that the goal of these projects is to inspire children to become interested in technology and be inspired to create their own creative computer programming projects. By always keeping this goal in mind when creating projects, you can ensure that students will have a happy, enjoyable experience and want to come back again!
